## API Surface (CRITICAL — read before any integration work)

The gateway at port `18789` exposes **two APIs**:

| API | Transport | Auth |
|-----|-----------|------|
| Control / Channels | WebSocket (proprietary protocol) | Bearer token via `connect` frame |
| **OpenAI-compatible REST** | HTTP | `Authorization: Bearer <token>` |

### REST endpoints (OpenAI-compatible)
```
GET  /v1/models
GET  /v1/models/{id}
POST /v1/chat/completions     ← use this for HA / any OpenAI client
POST /v1/embeddings
POST /v1/responses
```

Auth header: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`  
Token source: `gateway.auth.token` in `openclaw.json`  
Generate: `openclaw doctor --generate-gateway-token`

> **Unauthenticated requests return 404, not 401** (security through obscurity).  
> Always include the Bearer token; without it the endpoint appears not to exist.

## This Deployment: green-house

See `references/green-house.md` for full deployment details.

Key facts:
- Server: `mi-servidor` (<IP_SERVIDOR> dynamic, local DNS resolves `mi-servidor`)
- Process: `node openclaw/dist/index.js gateway --port 18789`
- LAN proxy: `http://green-house/api/openclaw/` → nginx → :18789
- HA bridge: `http://green-house/api/gateway/v1/` → jota-gateway → OpenClaw REST

## Common CLI Commands

```bash
openclaw gateway start|stop|restart|status
openclaw dashboard                    # open Control UI
openclaw skills list
openclaw skills install <name>        # from ClawHub
openclaw agent --message "..."
openclaw doctor                       # diagnose config issues
openclaw doctor --generate-gateway-token
```

## Troubleshooting Quick Reference

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| `/v1/chat/completions` returns 404 | Missing `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header |
| Skill not loading | `openclaw skills list`, check YAML frontmatter, run `/new` |
| Config changes ignored | `openclaw gateway restart` |
| Auth challenge failing | Check token in `openclaw.json` → `gateway.auth.token` |
| Gateway won't start | `openclaw gateway status`, check port 18789 not in use |
